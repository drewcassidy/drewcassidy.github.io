Hello! I am a maker, programmer, and hacker living in Southern California. I’m currently studying Electrical Engineering at the University of California, Irvine.

I don't have much on this website right now, but I plan to document all my future and some of my past projects here, as well as blog posts documenting my progress in whatever I'm working on, or whatever other ramblings I might have.
